Hello there! If you're reading this, it probably means you're in the wrong place, or you're just here to look at some of our (Theodor And Kalles) old work, anyways, here is some information on how to set edit this git!

1. First thing, download/clone the latest version of the github project.

2. Download XAMPP to be able to run the SQL and PHP. Here is the download link: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

3. Start up Apache and MySQL by pressing the "Start" button in xampp

4. Locate your xampp folder (Most likely in C:\ or C:\Program Files)

5. Open htdocs (A folder in xampp)

5. In your htdocs folder, delete all files inside of it (Unless you have used it before)

5.1 (Optional): Create a folder to store the files.

6. Open the folder in VS Code (the htdocs or your optional folder)

7. Do CTRL + SHIFT + P and enter "git clone"

8. Enter this link: "https://github.com/TheodorLindberg/Skol-tv.git"

9. Select the htdocs or optional folder. You should now see the files in the explorer.

10. You're done! To see you're edits, open chrome or another web browser and enter "localhost". If you don't see anything, make sure you're XAMPP Program control is online.
